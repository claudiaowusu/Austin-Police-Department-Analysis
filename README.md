# 📊 Austin Police Department Incident Analysis

## Overview  
This project analyzes **Austin Police Department (APD) incident data** to uncover trends, performance insights, and operational challenges. The analysis focuses on understanding response times, mental health-related incidents, geographic patterns, officer/subject safety, and overall workload distribution across time, sectors, and priorities.  

The work uses **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

## 🔎 Objectives  
- Identify **busiest times and days** for incidents.  
- Compare **incident types** (e.g., dispatched vs officer-initiated).  
- Analyze **response times** across sectors, priorities, and incident categories.  
- Evaluate the **impact of mental health-related incidents** across the city.  
- Assess **resource allocation** (units dispatched, on-scene times).  
- Highlight incidents involving **officer and subject injuries/fatalities**.  
- Provide insights for **police chiefs and decision-makers** to improve resource planning.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes fields such as:  
- `Incident Number`, `Incident Type`  
- `Response Datetime`, `Response Day of Week`, `Response Hour`  
- `Final Problem Category`, `Final Problem Description`  
- `Priority Level`, `Number of Units Arrived`, `Unit Time on Scene`  
- `Sector`, `Council District`, `Geo ID`  
- `Mental Health Flag`, `Officer Injured/Killed Count`, `Subject Injured/Killed Count`

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **Busiest Days & Hours** → Calls peak during evenings and weekends, mostly dispatched incidents.  
- **Response Times** → Certain sectors and high-priority incidents face **longer-than-average response times**.  
- **Mental Health-Related Incidents** → Present across multiple sectors, with some areas exceeding **30% of total incidents**.  
- **Officer & Subject Safety** → A number of cases involve serious injuries/fatalities linked to mental health.  
- **Resource Deployment** → Average number of units dispatched varies widely across incident categories.
